Welcome to Open Simulation Interface's documentation!
=====================================================

The Project
==================
The Open Simulation Interface (OSI) is a generic interface for the environmental perception of automated driving functions in virtual scenarios.

As the complexity of automated driving functions rapidly increases, the requirements for test and development methods are growing. Testing in virtual environments offers the advantage of completely controlled and reproducible environment conditions.

In this context, OSI defines generic interfaces to ensure modularity, integrability, and interchangeability of the individual components:
