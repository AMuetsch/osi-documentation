*https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/open-simulation-interface/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3Av3.1.1[Content/Changes]*

* **Bug Fix**: Changed open_simulation_interface target back from being a static library to a shared library, as before (this reverts an inadvertent change in v3.1.0 from previous releases).
v3.1.0 breaks all users of the shared library (i.e. everyone building on Linux/Unix systems, and even some using the DLL on Windows).
