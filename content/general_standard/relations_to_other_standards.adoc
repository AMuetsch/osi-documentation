== Positioning of {THIS_STANDARD} within ASAM activities

{THIS_STANDARD} (Open Simulation Interface) is part of the ASAM simulation standards that focus on simulation data for the automotive environment.
Next to {THIS_STANDARD}, ASAM provides other standards for the simulation domain, like OpenDRIVE cite:[opendrive], OpenSCENARIO cite:[openscenario] and OpenCRG cite:[opencrg].

OpenDRIVE defines a storage format for the static description of road networks.
In combination with OpenCRG it is possible to add very detailed road surface descriptions to the road network.
OpenDRIVE and OpenCRG only contain static content.
To add dynamic content, OpenSCENARIO is needed.
Combining all three standards provides a scenario-driven description of traffic simulation that contains static and dynamic content.
